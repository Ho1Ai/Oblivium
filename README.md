# Oblivium
Oblivium is a free and open source 2D game engine, which uses Rust as a main language. 

## Developers
Main developer is Aftergate Open Source Team (sometimes may be mentioned as AOST). This team includes full Morlix Team and some other people from other teams.   
But any way you can add something to this engine, if you want. We wanna make Rust popular in indie-gamedev. 

## To be added
List of those feature, which have not been added yet...  
1. Game engine itself (still indev)
2. 3D. Will be added
